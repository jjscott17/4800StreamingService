# Cosmic Streaming
Cosmic Streaming is a movie streaming service consisting of a login page, register page, dashboard, home page, and watch page. Users are able to register an account and then log in (passwords are encrypted). <br><br>
After logging in, the user will be taken to the dashboard where they will be able to change their username and profile picture. <br><br>
From the dashboard, the user can then click the home button to take them to the home page, which displays all of the movies, which are categorized by genre. <br><br>
There will be a search bar at the top of the home page that allows the user to search for a specific movie, and while the user types, the movies being displayed will be filtered based on what has been typed in the search bar. <br><br>
The home button on the home page will refresh the home page. The settings drop down shows two buttons: Profile and Logout. The profile button takes the user to the dashboard while the logout button logs the user out and takes them back to the login page. <br><br>
If the user clicks on a movie on the home page, they will be taken to the watch page. The watch page contains a video playes, where the user can press the play button to watch the movie. After clicking play, the user can click the corresponding buttons to skip forward or backward 10 seconds, as well as adjusting the volume slider or clicking the volume button to mute/unmute.
